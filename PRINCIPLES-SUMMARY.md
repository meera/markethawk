# EarningLens Governing Principles

## The Problem
**Earnings calls are drab and uninteresting.**

## Our Solution
**Convert audio into visually stimulating video + supplement with peripheral web data.**

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Audio is Sacred (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Use ACTUAL earnings call audio (30-60 minutes)
- NEVER synthesize, paraphrase, or alter
- Strict adherence to original audio + SEC filings + initial Prompt
- If CEO says "revenue up 6%", show exactly 6% - not 5%, not 7%, not "nearly 6%"

### 2. Never Make Up Data
- No guessing
- No inferring
- No rounding that changes meaning
- If uncertain → don't show it
-  original audio + SEC filings + initial Prompt = source of truth

### 3. Trust Through Source Verification
Carefully select data sources:

**Always Trust:**
- Earnings call audio (official)
- SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K)
- Company investor relations
- Official press releases

**Verify First:**
- Bloomberg, Reuters, WSJ
- Yahoo Finance, Google Finance
- Seeking Alpha transcripts

**Never Use:**
- Unverified sources
- AI-generated summaries (unless official)
- Forums, message boards
- Promotional content

### 4. Visual Enhancement Strategy
- Speaker identification (photo + name)
- Dynamic metrics when mentioned ("up 9000%" → show ↑ 9000%)
- Charts and graphs from SEC filings
- Company branding throughout
- All synchronized to audio

### 5. Peripheral Data (Web App)
- Supplement video with contextual data
- Present in interactive web application
- All data traceable to source
- Clear distinction between:
  - What was said in call (facts)
  - Additional context (clearly labeled)

### 6. Traffic Generation
- Create YouTube Shorts (30-60s clips)
- Extract key moments from full video
- Drive traffic: Shorts → Full video → Web app
- 10 Shorts per earnings call

## Content Rules

### ✅ DO:
- Play original audio in full
- Show speaker when they speak
- Display metrics exactly as stated
- Add context from SEC filings (labeled as "Additional Context")
- Cite all external data sources
- Create clips from actual moments

### ❌ DON'T:
- Summarize or paraphrase
- Show data not mentioned (unless clearly labeled)
- Mix opinions with facts
- Use clickbait or sensational language
- Alter timing or sequence
- Remove context that changes meaning

## Example: The Right Way

**Audio says:**
> "Revenue was $94.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year"

**We show:**
```
[Speaker: Tim Cook, CEO]
┌──────────────────┐
│  REVENUE         │
│  $94.9B          │
│  ↑ +6% YoY       │
└──────────────────┘
```

**We DON'T show:**
- "Revenue nearly $95B" ❌ (rounding changes meaning)
- "Strong revenue growth" ❌ (subjective interpretation)
- Comparison to competitors ❌ (unless mentioned in call)

This is our governing principle. Every decision, every feature, every line of code should align with these principles.

**When in doubt, ask:**
1. Is this audio accurate?
2. Is this data verified?
3. Would I trust this if I saw it?
4. Does this enhance or distort?

If the answer to any is "no" → don't ship it.
