# MarketHawk TODO

## 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY - Web App (Stripe Subscription Flow)

### Setup Tasks (Required to enable payments)
- [ ] **Get Stripe Price ID from payment link dashboard**
  - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/products
  - Find the $39/month product
  - Copy the Price ID (starts with `price_`)

- [ ] **Add STRIPE_STANDARD_PRICE_ID to Vercel environments**
  ```bash
  vercel env add STRIPE_STANDARD_PRICE_ID production preview development
  # Paste: price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
  ```

- [ ] **Set up Stripe webhook endpoint**
  - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
  - Click "Add endpoint"
  - URL: `https://markethawkeye.com/api/auth/stripe/webhook`
  - Description: "Better Auth subscription webhooks"

- [ ] **Configure webhook events**
  - Select these events:
    - `checkout.session.completed`
    - `customer.subscription.created`
    - `customer.subscription.updated`
    - `customer.subscription.deleted`
    - `invoice.paid`
    - `invoice.payment_failed`
  - Save and copy the webhook signing secret (already in Vercel as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)

### Testing Tasks (After setup complete)
- [ ] **Test subscription checkout flow end-to-end**
  - Sign in as test user
  - Click "Subscribe" button
  - Complete payment in Stripe
  - Verify redirect back to site

- [ ] **Verify webhook receives payment events**
  - Check Vercel logs for webhook events
  - Confirm `checkout.session.completed` event received

- [ ] **Confirm user subscriptionTier updates in database**
  - Query database: `SELECT email, subscriptionTier, stripeCustomerId FROM markethawkeye.user`
  - Verify `subscriptionTier` changed from `free` to `standard`

- [ ] **Test subscription cancellation flow**
  - Go to Stripe customer portal
  - Cancel subscription
  - Verify webhook updates user to `free` tier

## 🐛 BUGS TO FIX - Web App

### Google OAuth Error
- [ ] **Fix Google OAuth "invalid_code" error**
  - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
  - Edit OAuth client: `705115709352-16lr9pg6228ub9909ldvgsgjigh2nj58`
  - Add authorized redirect URIs:
    - `https://markethawkeye.com/api/auth/callback/google`
    - `https://www.markethawkeye.com/api/auth/callback/google`
    - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
  - Save changes

- [ ] **Fix GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET leading space in Vercel**
  ```bash
  vercel env rm GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET production
  vercel env add GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET production
  # Paste: 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 (no leading space!)
  ```

### Domain Redirect Issue
- [ ] **Fix www → non-www redirect loop**
  - Currently: `markethawkeye.com` redirects to `www.markethawkeye.com`
  - Expected: `www.markethawkeye.com` should redirect to `markethawkeye.com`
  - Check Vercel domain settings or DNS configuration

## 🎥 VIDEO PIPELINE TODO

### Architecture Refactor - Flexible Pipeline System

#### Migrate to YAML-based Workflow System
**Current**: Hardcoded pipeline in `lens/process_earnings.py` with fixed steps
**Goal**: Flexible, composable workflows defined in YAML

**Benefits**:
- Experiment with different processing pipelines without code changes
- Mix and match steps in any order (e.g., skip transcription for pre-transcribed videos)
- Compare different approaches side-by-side (different LLM models, different video styles)
- Easier to add new steps without modifying existing code
- Better separation of concerns (steps are decoupled)

**Architecture Pattern** (Industry standard - Airflow/Prefect style):
```python
# Current (coupled):
def process_earnings(video_id):
    download(video_id)
    parse(video_id)
    transcribe(video_id)
    extract_insights(video_id)
    # Each step knows about file paths

# Proposed (decoupled):
@StepRegistry.register
class DownloadVideo(Step):
    def process(self, **params):
        return {'output': 'path/to/video.mp4', 'video_id': 'ABC123'}

# YAML workflow:
workflow:
  - step: download_video
    id: download
    params: {url: "${input.url}"}

  - step: transcribe
    params: {input: ${download.output}}

  - step: extract_insights
    params: {transcript: ${transcribe.output}}
```

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Create `lens/step.py` - Base Step class and Registry pattern
- [ ] Create `lens/workflow.py` - YAML parser and execution engine
- [ ] Refactor existing steps to inherit from Step class:
  - [ ] `lens/steps/download_video.py`
  - [ ] `lens/steps/parse_metadata.py`
  - [ ] `lens/steps/remove_silence.py`
  - [ ] `lens/steps/transcribe.py`
  - [ ] `lens/steps/extract_insights.py`
- [ ] Create example workflow configs:
  - [ ] `workflows/standard.yaml` - Full pipeline
  - [ ] `workflows/quick.yaml` - Skip silence removal for speed
  - [ ] `workflows/insights_only.yaml` - Process existing transcript
  - [ ] `workflows/retranscribe.yaml` - Re-run just transcription step
- [ ] Create `lens/run_workflow.py` - New workflow runner
- [ ] Keep backward compatibility: `process_earnings.py` wraps workflow engine
- [ ] Add workflow comparison tools (diff configs, compare results)

**Key Design Patterns**:
- Step Pattern: Each operation is a reusable class
- Registry Pattern: Auto-discover steps via decorator
- Data Flow: Steps pass file paths via return values
- Reference Resolution: `${step_id.output}` syntax in YAML

**Priority**: Medium-High (enables rapid experimentation, but current system works)

### High Priority - Video Generation

#### Thumbnail Validation Agent
**Need**: Automated thumbnail validation to ensure quality before upload
**Requirements**:
- Check text readability (sufficient contrast with background)
- Verify MarketHawk branding is visible
- Verify company branding (logo/colors) is prominent
- Ensure thumbnail is visually attractive and engaging
- Flag thumbnails that don't meet quality standards

**Implementation Ideas**:
- Use image analysis (PIL/OpenCV) to check contrast ratios
- OCR to verify text is readable
- Brand color detection (check for company brand colors)
- Visual quality metrics (sharpness, composition)

**Priority**: High (quality control for YouTube thumbnails)

---

### Critical Issues - Video Pipeline

#### 1. Context Length Exceeded for Insights Extraction
**Error**: Transcript is 522k tokens, but OpenAI model limit is 128k tokens
**File**: `lens/extract_insights.py`
**Impact**: Cannot extract insights from full transcript

**Solutions to explore**:
1. **Chunk the transcript** - Process in smaller segments
2. **Use longer context model** - GPT-4 Turbo 128k or Claude 200k
3. **Summarize first** - Create summary, then extract insights
4. **Extract incrementally** - Process sections (revenue, EPS, guidance separately)

Make sure transcript.paragraphs.json is used to send to LLM.
**Priority**: Medium (MVP works without insights)
